# idea-generator
Build a “Stuck? Try this!” webpage—a simple, beautiful, creative idea generator. The idea is to make a page someone could visit when they’re feeling creatively blocked, bored, or uninspired.

## Part 1: Structure the Idea Generator (HTML + Semantics)

### Create a single-page HTML layout that includes:

- header: Site name/logo and nav links (e.g., “Home”, “How It Works”, “About”)

- hero: A bold heading and a subheading that explains the purpose (“Feeling stuck? Here’s your creative spark.”)

**Main Content:**

- A **>section<** or **>article<** with placeholder idea(s). Use **>h2<** + a paragraph to describe the type of ideas you’ll eventually show.

- Maybe a few prewritten examples of ideas (inside **>div<s** or **>ul<**) so you have structure to replace with JS later.

- CTA section: A big friendly button that doesn’t do anything yet—this will be wired up with JavaScript next week.

- footer: Your name or brand + copyright

## Part 2: Style the Experience (CSS + Flexbox + Box Model)
Your Task:
- Make your site visually engaging and clean to navigate.

- **Link a CSS file** and style it from scratch.

Show off:

- Box model with padding, margin, border

- Fixed widths or responsive containers

- RGBA color for transparent backgrounds (use it in your hero or CTA)

- A reset/override of browser default styles (e.g., normalize **>ul<**, style your **>button<**)

- **Use Flexbox** in at least one section:

- Horizontally align nav links

- Vertically center your hero content

- Lay out example ideas side by side
