# idea-generator
A website to inspire some ideas

## Part 1: Structure the Idea Generator (HTML + Semantics)

### Create a single-page HTML layout that includes:

- header: Site name/logo and nav links (e.g., “Home”, “How It Works”, “About”)

- hero: A bold heading and a subheading that explains the purpose (“Feeling stuck? Here’s your creative spark.”)

**Main Content:**

A **>section<** or **>article<** with placeholder idea(s). Use **>h2<** + a paragraph to describe the type of ideas you’ll eventually show.

Maybe a few prewritten examples of ideas (inside **>div<s** or **>ul<**) so you have structure to replace with JS later.

CTA section: A big friendly button that doesn’t do anything yet—this will be wired up with JavaScript next week.

footer: Your name or brand + copyright
